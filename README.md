# Simulations of Liouville Quantum Gravity

Here you will find some of my simulations of Liouville Quantum gravity and Eden models on it.

If you go to the 'Grid Models' folder you will find some simulations of unit balls for LQG in a torus, some DLA aggregation processes... this is part of my Master thesis, so I will update my progress from time to time!
